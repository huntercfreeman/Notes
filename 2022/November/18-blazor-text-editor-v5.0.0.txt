        []Following "In App.razor, where the Blazor Router is located, at the top of the file add the following Razor markup"
            is a code snippet where the code snippet erroneously contains a tab key at the start of the snippet.
    []20_SETTINGS.md
        []In the Goal section
            []The third bullet currently says
                []'Render each settings individually where desired.'
                []It has 'settings' when it should have the singular 'setting'
                []It should say: 'Render each setting individually where desired.'
        []The bullet: "Above where the button is to open the settings dialog. 
            Render the razor components shown in the following markup."
            []Needs to have a code snippet above it telling the reader to add

    []Showcase how one would read local storage when their Blazor app starts
        to initialize the TextEditor settings.
[]Bugs
    []I have 3 bugs currently listed after this regarding 'invisible text' when deleting
        []I more recently found it LIKELY is exactly due to both
            [X]Pasting when having a selection.
                [X]Pasting over a selection is fixed
            [X]Overtype in general is not working
            [X]Or 'delete key' when at the end of the file with the cursor
            [X]Hit the Cut command when cursor is at the end of a document bug occurs
            []Got exception Index was out of range \TextEditorBase.PrivateMethods.cs:line 376 but 
                is this a side effect instead of the problem?
    []Take a look into the deletion logic and 'delete key'
        []Seemingly invisible text can appear due to this logic.
    []Take a look into pasting over a selection
        []Seemingly invisible text can appear due to this logic.
    []Take a look into deletion 'delete key' at the very last cursor position possible.
        []It seemingly deletes as if one hits 'backspace key' and
            can cause invisible text.
[]Publish the demo

[]Dialog is missing overflow for settings
