# Goal
{
[]Currently the Blazor.Text.Editor has a light theme
which is using the color red for various css variables.
    []This was done as a TODO in a sense and the goal is to
        set values that match for the light theme instead of red.
}

# Plan
{
[]Perhaps a similarity between the Light and Dark theme colors
    is a good idea.
    []So, I will give the similar color idea a try.
        []That is to say, if dark theme has keywords colored pink.
            []Then perhaps it is a good idea to make the keywords
                pink in the light theme albeit a different shade.
    []Try to keep the colors similar to the respective Visual Studio
        themes as to have a sense of familiarity and not feel
        like the colors are out of place.
    []The Dark theme is likely finalized at this point in time
        and so I want the light theme to mimic the concepts
        involved in the dark theme as to match the "similarity between
        themes" idea.
