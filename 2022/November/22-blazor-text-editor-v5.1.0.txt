# Goal
{

[]Fix horizontal scrolling.
    

}

# Plan
{

[]The TextEditorDisplay Blazor Component is rather unwieldy and I
    want to break down the Blazor Component to render internally a component
    foreach feature as to encapsulate that feature's code behind a Component Tag
    reference.
    []Move as much code from the codebehind of TextEditorDisplay.razor.cs into
        the Blazor Components that are made today where it makes sense.
    []Make the following Blazor Components and swap out the respective inline Razor markup
        with a rendering of the Blazor Component with any Blazor Parameters passed in
        that are necessary.
        []MeasureCharacterWidthAndRowHeight
            []Put it in place of div with class: "bte_measure-character-width-and-row-height"
            []private fields
                []string _testStringForMeasurement
                []int _testStringRepeatCount
            []public properties
                []string ElementId // public get only for access from @ref when JavaScript
                []int CountOfTestCharacters // expression bound
                    []// so TextEditorDisplay can use an @ref to access the CountOfTestCharacters
                        when invoking the javascript function to measure width of characters
                        and height of rows.
    []Can all of the div with class of "bte_text-editor" be moved so the attributes
        are on the child div with class of "bte_text-editor-content" (the "bte_text-editor"
        div would then be removed and 1 less div. I don't see the point of the parent div
        if there is a point that is fine but its existence must be justified.)
