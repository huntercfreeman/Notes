# Goal
{

[]Fix horizontal scrolling.
    

}

# Plan
{

[]The TextEditorDisplay Blazor Component is rather unwieldy and I
    want to break down the Blazor Component to render internally a component
    foreach feature as to encapsulate that feature's code behind a Component Tag
    reference.
    []Move as much code from the codebehind of TextEditorDisplay.razor.cs into
        the Blazor Components that are made today where it makes sense.
    []Make the following Blazor Components and swap out the respective inline Razor markup
        with a rendering of the Blazor Component with any Blazor Parameters passed in
        that are necessary.
        []MeasureCharacterWidthAndRowHeight
            []Put it in place of div with class: "bte_measure-character-width-and-row-height"
            []Blazor Parameters
                []string ElementId 
                    []// Used by TextEditorDisplay.razor.cs to target the element 
                        when invoking JavaScript for measuring character width and row height.
            []private fields
                []string _testStringForMeasurement
                []int _testStringRepeatCount
            []public properties
                []int CountOfTestCharacters // expression bound
                    []// so TextEditorDisplay can use an @ref to access the CountOfTestCharacters
                        when invoking the javascript function to measure width of characters
                        and height of rows.
            []public methods
                []None
            []private methods
                []None
        []TextSelectionGroup
            []Put it in place of div with class: "bte_text-selection-group"
            []Blazor Parameters
                []TextEditorCursorSnapshot PrimaryCursorSnapshot
            []private fields
                []None
            []public properties
                []None
            []public methods
                []None
            []private methods
                []string GetTextSelectionStyleCss(int lowerBound, int upperBound, int rowIndex)
    []Can all of the div with class of "bte_text-editor" be moved so the attributes
        are on the child div with class of "bte_text-editor-content" (the "bte_text-editor"
        div would then be removed and 1 less div. I don't see the point of the parent div
        if there is a point that is fine but its existence must be justified.)
    []In TextSelectionGroup.GetTextSelectionStyleCss(...) CharacterWidthAndRowHeight
        is checked for is null. Ensure this is necessary I believe the Razor
        markup checked this already in TextEditorDisplay.
        []Fixed, moved TextSelectionGroup to inside a null check within TextEditorDisplay
            and removed null check from within TextSelectionGroup
    []Move TextSelectionGroup within the VirtualizationDisplay.ChildContent
    []Move bte_gutter into a Component with div having class of "bte_gutter-section"
        this encompassing div should do nothing and the position absolute of the gutters
        should still point to the bte_text-editor-content.
        []Do this so when using inspect element the gutters are kept behind
            a level of nesting so they don't make debugging the html
            noisy.
    []Move bte_row into a Component with div having class of "bte_row-section"
        this encompassing div should do nothing and the position absolute of the rows
        should still point to the bte_text-editor-content.
        []Do this so when using inspect element the rows are kept behind
            a level of nesting so they don't make debugging the html
            noisy.
