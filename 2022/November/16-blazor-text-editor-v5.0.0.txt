# TODO ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[]Ensure '15-blazor-text-editor-v5.0.0.txt' has its goals met
    []Copy TODO items from '15-blazor-text-editor-v5.0.0.txt' to this file?
[X]BUG: delete all text and try to autocomplete. It wont 
    until you are infront of a newline of any kind
    [X]Happens more simply "It wont until you are infront of 
        a newline of any kind"
        [X]That is to say the 'delete all text' part is irrelevant.
    [X]Fixed: issue was check index out of bounds but did length -1 along with >= instead of >
[]Making the Demo app
[]Undo / Redo should track and restore the cursor
    position, and selection.
[]If one has a selection and does an undo / redo of which
    results in the selection being out of bounds of the index
    for the _content and index out of bounds exception
    is thrown.
[]Need document Helper Components
[]Make sure to update README.md
    []One of such update would be to link to
        INSTALLATION markdown instead of the deprecated
        gettingStarted markdown
[]Do not scroll cursor into view if out of view when hitting modifier keys
