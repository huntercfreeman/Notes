# Goal
{
[]Rewrite the TreeView logic
}

# Observations about the tree view example made
    from BlazorStudio's source code.
{
[]What unique datatypes were necessary?
    []DotNetSolutionTreeView
    []DotNetSolutionFolderTreeView
    []CSharpProjectTreeView
    []ProjectDependenciesTreeView
    []ProjectReferencesTreeView
    []ProjectNugetPackagesTreeView
    []DirectoryTreeView
    []FileTreeView
[]What irregular occurrences were there.
    []Irregularly a FileTreeView would
        have a child FileTreeView.
        []See: ".razor" when the parent directory also 
            contains ".razor.cs"
    []Irregularly a DirectoryTreeView would
        not include a file system entry.
        []See: ".razor" when the DirectoryTreeView also 
            contains ".razor.cs"
}

# What is the naive approach to get the children
    foreach of the different TreeView types in an
    isolated manner such that every TreeView loads
    their own children in isolation from one another.

    *NOTE* every TreeView loads
    their own children in isolation from one another
    is to say, a FileTreeView must not depend on
    its parent DirectoryTreeView having been loaded
    in order to load itself.
