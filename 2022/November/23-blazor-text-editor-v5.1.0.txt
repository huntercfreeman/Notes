# Goal
{

[]Determine 
    []If v5.1.0 should be published on Friday.
    []What the general theme of v5.1.0 changes were.
    []Exactly what has changed in v5.1.0
    []What should be finished for the release of v5.1.0
    []If enough of what should be finished for the release of v5.1.0
        will realistically be done in time to warrant an update.

# Plan
{

[]v5.1.0 deals with fixing issues regarding scrolling.
    []It includes the following keymap additions
        []PageDown
            []Scroll vertically down at most the height of the view
        []PageUp
            []Scroll vertically up at most the height of the view
        []Ctrl + PageDown
            []Move cursor to the last viewable row given the current view.
        []Ctrl + PageUp
            []Move cursor to the first viewable row given the current view.
        []Ctrl + ArrowDown
            []Scroll the view down by the height of one line without moving the cursor.
        []Ctrl + ArrowUp
            []Scroll the view up by the height of one line without moving the cursor.
    []Scrollbar changes
        []The scrollbars are now custom made by way of overflow: hidden as opposed
            to the native scrollbars that were used by way of overflow: auto.
        []Now will prevent propagation on all mouse events when interacting with the scrollbar.
            []Explanation: previously clicking the native scrollbar would propagate that click
                event to the text editor causing a janky and mostly unusable scrolling behavior to occur.
        []Scrolling the cursor into view if it is out of view is now done using C# as 
            opposed to the way it was of a JavaScript intersection observer.
            []A keyboard event which results in the cursor going out of view will automatically
                scroll the cursor into view.
                []Explanation: previously a cursor going out of view would sometimes not scroll the cursor into view
                    until the next keyboard event after having gone out of view.
        []The line numbers are no longer part of the horizontal scrollbar.
        []When scrolling horizontally beyond a scrollLeft of 0. It previously
            was the case that a keyboard event which brought the cursor to column 0
            would display the cursor inside the gutter/margin because the scrollLeft
            was not accounting for the gutter width.
            []This has been fixed.
    []Side changes
        []ILexer changes
            []F# ILexer added
                []Keywords are syntax highlighted
            []JavaScript ILexer
                []Keywords are syntax highlighted
            []TypeScript ILexer
                []Keywords are syntax highlighted
        []TextEditorLexerDefault rename
        []TextEditorDecorationMapperDefault rename

[]Bugs
    []One can scroll horizontally beyond the maximum horizontal scroll distance???
    []Cannot use mouse to set scrollbar slider
        []OnClick
        []OnDrag
    []Scrollbar slider needs css changes it does not look good
    []Scrollbar slider needs css for both light and dark theme
    []On mouse up of the TextEditor should clear scrollbar thinking it is mousedowned
    []Does a TextEditor being modified rerenders all text editors?
        []It feels like this is true when running with WebAssembly single threaded
    []Scrolling occurs prematurely when the gutter does not fill the vertical view
