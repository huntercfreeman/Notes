# Goal
{

[]When writing the ILexer(s) make sure to
    []Paint text which is marked as DecorationKind.None
        []Otherwise the syntax highlighting text previously
            was given never disappears.
[]Lex css files in their entirety by the end of the day.
    [X]Comments

[]BUG:
    []If there is nowhere to vertically scroll (the vertical view is not overflowed)
        then the vertical scroll can be scrolled infinitely in one direction
    []The user then has to vertically scroll in the opposite direction

[]BUG: (TreeView specificially related)
    []Javascript feels to randomly throw an exception something about is

[]BUG: (BlazorStudio specificially related)
    []Created templated file 'Index.razor.cs' when Index.razor existed
    []This resulted in 'Index.razor.cs' being created.
    []However, 'Index.razor.cs' does not display in the tree view likely because
        'Index.razor' is claiming it as a related file (so it should nest like a codebehind
            in the TreeView).
    []But, Index.razor was never told to refresh its children and render
        'Index.razor.cs' as nested. So 'Index.razor.cs' thereby would never appear
        until 'Index.razor' was told to reload its children.
