# Goal
{

[x]Update 
    [X]CHANGELOG.md
    [X]ROADMAP.md
[X]Locally dotnet build and dotnet pack the nuget package source code
    [X]Reference the local version of v5.1.0 and ensure everything is working.
    [X]Update the demo (that is to say publish to the staging website and swap afterwards) to that exact local instance of v5.1.0 (it had been published as v5.1.0 previously
        but you must use the exact nuget package file you are going to publish as there may have been changes.)
[](do not publish this video yet) Make a youtube video going over the changes in v5.1.0
[]Publish v5.1.0 of Blazor.Text.Editor NuGet Package
[]Update github to have a release and git tag that points to the commit used
    for the v5.1.0 NuGet Package
[]Publish the previously made youtube video going over the changes in v5.1.0 with
    a title and thumbnail that clearly indicates v5.1.0 is available on NuGet

[]BUG:
    []If there is nowhere to vertically scroll (the vertical view is not overflowed)
        then the vertical scroll can be scrolled infinitely in one direction
    []The user then has to vertically scroll in the opposite direction

[]BUG: (TreeView specificially related)
    []Javascript feels to randomly throw an exception something about is

[]BUG: (BlazorStudio specificially related)
    []Created templated file 'Index.razor.cs' when Index.razor existed
    []This resulted in 'Index.razor.cs' being created.
    []However, 'Index.razor.cs' does not display in the tree view likely because
        'Index.razor' is claiming it as a related file (so it should nest like a codebehind
            in the TreeView).
    []But, Index.razor was never told to refresh its children and render
        'Index.razor.cs' as nested. So 'Index.razor.cs' thereby would never appear
        until 'Index.razor' was told to reload its children.
