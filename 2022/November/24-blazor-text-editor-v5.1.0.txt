# Goal
{

[]Determine 
    []If v5.1.0 should be published on Friday.
    []What the general theme of v5.1.0 changes were.
    []Exactly what has changed in v5.1.0
    []What should be finished for the release of v5.1.0
    []If enough of what should be finished for the release of v5.1.0
        will realistically be done in time to warrant an update.

# Plan
{

[]v5.1.0 deals with fixing issues regarding scrolling.
    []It includes the following keymap additions
        []PageDown
            []Scroll vertically down at most the height of the view
        []PageUp
            []Scroll vertically up at most the height of the view
        []Ctrl + PageDown
            []Move cursor to the last viewable row given the current view.
        []Ctrl + PageUp
            []Move cursor to the first viewable row given the current view.
        []Ctrl + ArrowDown
            []Scroll the view down by the height of one line without moving the cursor.
        []Ctrl + ArrowUp
            []Scroll the view up by the height of one line without moving the cursor.
    []Scrollbar changes
        []The scrollbars are now custom made by way of overflow: hidden as opposed
            to the native scrollbars that were used by way of overflow: auto.
        []Now will prevent propagation on all mouse events when interacting with the scrollbar.
            []Explanation: previously clicking the native scrollbar would propagate that click
                event to the text editor causing a janky and mostly unusable scrolling behavior to occur.
        []Scrolling the cursor into view if it is out of view is now done using C# as 
            opposed to the way it was of a JavaScript intersection observer.
            []A keyboard event which results in the cursor going out of view will automatically
                scroll the cursor into view.
                []Explanation: previously a cursor going out of view would sometimes not scroll the cursor into view
                    until the next keyboard event after having gone out of view.
        []The line numbers are no longer part of the horizontal scrollbar.
        []When scrolling horizontally beyond a scrollLeft of 0. It previously
            was the case that a keyboard event which brought the cursor to column 0
            would display the cursor inside the gutter/margin because the scrollLeft
            was not accounting for the gutter width.
            []This has been fixed.
    []Side changes
        []ILexer changes
            []F# ILexer added
                []Keywords are syntax highlighted
            []JavaScript ILexer
                []Keywords are syntax highlighted
            []TypeScript ILexer
                []Keywords are syntax highlighted
        []TextEditorLexerDefault rename
        []TextEditorDecorationMapperDefault rename

[]Bugs
    []One can scroll horizontally beyond the maximum horizontal scroll distance???
    []Cannot use mouse to set scrollbar slider
        []OnClick
        []OnDrag
    []Scrollbar slider needs css changes it does not look good
    []Scrollbar slider needs css for both light and dark theme
    []On mouse up of the TextEditor should clear scrollbar thinking it is mousedowned
    []Does a TextEditor being modified rerenders all text editors?
        []It feels like this is true when running with WebAssembly single threaded
    []Scrolling occurs prematurely when the gutter does not fill the vertical view

[]Look at the published version of the v5.1.0 demo and list and fix any bugs
    []NOTE: As of this note being written Blazor WebAssembly is single threaded.
        []Care needs to be taken to ensure the UI does not freeze.
            []Task.Yield() would be the first code used to remedy the problem.
                []If the UI freezing persists perhaps that method is able to be
                    batched or debounced/throttled.
        []Holding the enter key freezes the UI
    []Premature scrolling
        []Explanation: when there are 3 rows but the vertical view can fit 10 rows
            inserting a 4th will cause the view to scroll the 1st row out
            of view erroneously
        []Vertical especially
        []Maybe this also happens with premature horizontal scrolling?
    []Does the most characters on a line get updated as the User
        interacts with the text editor or only on initialization?
    []User action resulting in bug:
        []Go to end of the file.
        []Right click after the final character in the file.
        []Pick the cut option
        []Do the right click cut option a second time.
        []Up arrow keys to move cursor to start of line 171
        []Hit the 'EndKey'
            []BUGS:
                []Gutter is not being rendered (for clarity: there is no part of the gutter at all being rendered in view)
                []Caret row erroneously does not span the entire width of the scrollWidth
                []Hit ArrowLeft / Ctrl + ArrowLeft.
                    []The scrollLeft is not being changed even though the cursor is out of view
                    []Once the cursor reaches column index of 0, then the cursor finally is scrolled into view.
                    []IDEA:
                        []The arrow left inner bug appears to be due to the cursor being within
                            the visual position of where the Gutter should be rendered.
        []DIFFERENT: I re-encountered this bug.
            []Refresh page
            []Ctrl + End to go to end of the file
            []Move cursor to line 171
            []Hit Home to go to start of the row
            []Hit End to go to the end of the row.
            []At this point PREVIOUSLY hitting the home
                key or moving ArrowUp or ArrowDown would
                scroll the cursor into view.
            []NOW however, I am seeing no keyboard event result in the cursor
                being scrolled into view when in this state
            []One must instead click on the text editor to scroll it into view.
                []Seemingly this click must be a different row than the line 171.
        []Scrolling vertically in this state all the text editor content disappears.
        []This bug is appearing locally when running Blazor ServerSide
    []User action resulting in bug:
        []Move the scrollTop (scroll down) such that the row with index 0
            is out of view.
        []Ctrl + A to select all the text
        []Then hit backspace.
            []NOTE: Ensure this when this bug is fixed that typing over a selection
                works properly as well as just basic deletion
        []The cursor will be moved to (row 0, column 0) as all the text will have
            been deleted.
        []However, the cursor will not be scrolled into view regardless of what keyboard
            input is given by the user at this point.
        []One must click on the text editor and then the cursor will be scrolled into view.
    []User action resulting in bug:
        []One can scroll horizontally very far if not infinitely?
    []User action resulting in bug:
        []Scrolling using mouse and horizontal scrollbar is not rerendering as the drag is performed.
    []User action resulting in bug:
        []Scrolling using mouse and horizontal scrollbar is 
        
        
// get new request force from virtualization request is not being updated
// overflow-hidden results in width: 100% no longer filling the viewable AND scrollable area
// instead only the initial location of the viewable area has the width of virtualization correct
// as the scrollbar width/height is no longer being included.
// Make a force reload virtualization method


[]BUG:When doing horizontal virtualization it seems tab key width is not accounted for?
    []Seeing nothing when using tab key to put text horizontally out of view then horizontally scrolling that text into view.
        []Proceeding to put an enter key to split the line and all the text appears again.
