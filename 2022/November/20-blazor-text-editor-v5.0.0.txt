# Goal
{

[]Fix horizontal scrolling.
    []Currently the horizontal scrollbar is shared by:
        []The line numbers.
        []The text content.
    []The line numbers should NOT have a scroll bar.
    []The text content should have its own scroll bar separate from
        the line numbers.
    []Currently the horizontal virtualization is being leveraged to
        modify the left css position of the line numbers in accordance
        to the scrollLeft.
        []This makes the line numbers scroll and stay in view al the
            user scrolls horizontally.
            []This however, is very janky, weird, and is the
                cause of some bugs.
                []One such bug is to scroll horizontally and then
                    use the keyboard 'Home' key to move the cursor
                    to column 0.
                    []When the JavaScript intersection observer fires
                        to the scroll the cursor into view because
                        it went out of view.
                        []The width of the line numbers is not accounted for
                            and the line numbers cover some of the beginning of each row.

# Plan
{

[]Fix horizontal scrolling.
    []Currently support for the keyboard scrolling inputs are not implemented.
        []PageUp
        []PageDown
        []Ctrl + PageUp
        []Ctrl + PageDown
        []Ctrl + ArrowUp
        []Ctrl + ArrowDown
    []As well the intersection observer which is to scroll the cursor
        into view has a timing issue where one might have to hit
        1 keyboard button to mark the cursor as out of view. Then another
        to actually perform the scroll into view.
        []The intersection observer logic for scrolling the cursor into view
            needs to be fixed such that the cursor consistently gets
            scrolled into view upon the FIRST keyboard button event that
            moves it out of view.
    []The reason for bringing up keyboard scrolling inputs and the intersection
        observer logic is:
        []The overall goal for this day is to fix horizontal scrolling.
            []I wonder if on a related note the implementation of
                the scrolling input and fixing the intersection observer logic
                would bring one to naturally fixing the horizontal scrolling.
                []That is to say, PageUp, requires one to knnow the height of
                    the text editor so the scrollbar can be moved at most
                    the height of the text editor if enough space remains.
                    []The idea of manipulating the scroll position either
                        vertical or horizontal forces one to further explore
                        the idea understanding what is rendered on the screen
                        by monitoring scroll position, width of the editor,
                        font size, etc...
                        []Is there a lack of the ITextEditorService
                            understanding and being able to manipulate the scrollbar?
                            []Would resolving this so the ITextEditorService understood
                                and could manipulate the scrollbar result in a natural
                                step by process that concludes in fixing horizontal scrolling?
    []What is the HTML markup generally going to look like?
        []-TextEditorDisplay
            []-TextEditorContent
                []VirtualizeVertically
                    []-TextEditorGutterWrap
                        []-TextEditorGutter
                        []-TextEditorGutter
                        []-TextEditorGutter
                        []-... foreach row make a TextEditorGutter
                    []-TextEditorRowWrap
                        []VirtualizeHorizontally
                            []-TextEditorRow
                            []-TextEditorRow
                            []-TextEditorRow
                            []-... foreach row make a TextEditorRow
    []The TextEditorContent is to contain the gutter wrap and the row wrap.
        []The TextEditorContent is to virtualized vertically
            []Instead of the virtualization component rendering out the
                virtualization result.
                []Would the virtualization result need to be returned?
            []TextEditorRowWrap needs horizontal virtualization ONLY
                as the vertical virtualization is provided by its parent element
    []Stay focused on the previous tasks however, remember for the future
        that the text selection is not virtualized. It renders that div
        for the background color even for text not being rendered due to
        being out of view.
