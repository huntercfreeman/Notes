# Background Information
{
BlazorStudio was made first
https://github.com/huntercfreeman/BlazorStudio

BlazorTextEditor was made second
https://github.com/huntercfreeman/BlazorTextEditor

Blazor.Text.Editor was made third to be a nuget package 
containing only the logic for the TextEditorDisplay
Blazor component. The TextEditorDisplay
Blazor component comes from what resulting in the
second repo named, "BlazorTextEditor".
https://github.com/huntercfreeman/Blazor.Text.Editor
}

# Goal / Plan
{
BlazorTextEditor has a lot of similar functionality to
that of BlazorStudio.

As well, due to BlazorTextEditor having been made after
BlazorStudio I feel a lot of those similar functionalities
were written better the second time around in BlazorTextEditor.

I want to take the "written better the second time around" code
from BlazorTextEditor and paste it over to BlazorStudio.
