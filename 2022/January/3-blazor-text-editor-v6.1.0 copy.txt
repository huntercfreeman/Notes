{

[]Vim Emulation:
    []When in either Visual Mode or Visual Line Mode
        []The typical vim commands should act on the selected text.
            []Example: 'd' should delete the selected text.
            []Example: 'c' should delete the selected text and change
                the Vim mode to Insert.
        []The typical vim motions should act on the selected text.
            []Example: 'w'
            []Example: 'j'
        []{ "EscapeKey" } => Set VimMode to Normal Mode
    []When in Visual Mode
        []{ "v" } => Set VimMode to Normal Mode
        []{ "V" } => Set VimMode to Visual Line Mode and expand
            the selected text accordingly. (make them the start/end of a line)
    []When in Visual Line Mode
        []{ "V" } => Set VimMode to Normal Mode
        []{ "v" } => Set VimMode to Visual Mode and alter the text selecting
            ending position accordingly. (from start/end of a line to where the cursor is within
            the current line.)
