# Goal
{

[]Work on finishing Blazor.Text.Editor v6.0.0
[]List Changes Here:
    []Tabs were added to the Text Editor
        []See `TextEditorGroup.cs`
    []Scroll position is maintained as state
        []See TextEditorViewModel.cs
    []Cursor position is maintained as state
        []See TextEditorViewModel.cs
    []TextEditor content and the Gutter do not share
        the same 'css position: absolute' relative parent.
        That is to say the TextEditor content is now separate from the Gutter.
        []Notes: previously the TextEditor content had a
            css position left that was offset by the width
            of the gutter. The left which represented the width
            of the gutter no longer needs to be put on each row.
    []Both the horizontal and vertical scrollbar now reside within
        the 'TextEditor content'. That is to say,
        separate from the Gutter.
        []Notes: previously the horizontal and vertical scrollbars had a
            css position left that was offset by the width
            of the gutter. The left which represented the width
            of the gutter no longer needs to be put on each row.
    []Margin-ScrollHeight is 40% of the page height;
    []<DialogInitializer/> and <NotificationInitializer/> go as children of the "<div class="page @TextEditorService.GlobalThemeCssClassString">"
    []Scroll bars use <DragDisplay/> from BlazorALaCarte

[]NOTES:
    []Make sure the UI renders as a transaction such that the
        state is evaluated once at the beginning and then a cascading
        parameter shares the EXACT same state to all child components
        so components cannot be out of sync.
