# Goal
{

[]Implement the ILexer for F#
    []Comments
        []Single Line Comment
            []// An example F# single line comment
        []Multi Line Comment
            [](* lets declare and print variable in F#   
                Here x is a integer variable  
              *)  
    []Strings
    []Keywords
[]The TextEditorDisplay scrollbar should listen for mousemove
    events in the viewport instead of the current functionality.
    []The current functionality is to listen for mousemove events
        within the rendered scrollbar html element.
        []This feels very awkward to use currently so
            using mousemove on viewport and displacing the
            scrollbar based on a position diff between 
            current and previous events instead of taking
            mouse position at time of event will
            feel much more natural.
[]When out of view of the first line and deleting all the Text
    one finds themselves NOT having the first line scrolled
    into view. This is erroneous and needs fixed.
[]Razor needs better ILexer implementation as 
    []@code{...}
    []@code
      {

      }
    []Previous two @code examples must be syntaxed highlighted
        properly.
        []Currently only the
            []@code{...}
                []Is syntax highlighted properly
[]Added in Svelte ILexer to work on alongside Razor ILexer.
    Helps with InjectedLanguageDefinition.cs figuring out what
    is needed.
