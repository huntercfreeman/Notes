# Goal
{

[]Work on finishing Blazor.Text.Editor v6.0.0

[]List Changes Here:
    []Summarize the changes here:
        []This update changes the already existing "TextEditorBase" class
            to instead be a model of a "unique file" if one uses the file system
            as an example use case.
        []Added the class "TextEditorViewModel". This class acts contains any state
            one previously found on the Blazor Component: "TextEditorDisplay.razor".
            This allows one to maintain the TextEditorCursor position for example
            as its state is no longer tied to the lifecycle of the
            "TextEditorDisplay.razor" Blazor Component.
        []Rename "TextEditorDisplay.razor" to "TextEditorViewModelDisplay.razor"
            and change the Blazor Parameter from "TextEditorKey" to "TextEditorViewModelKey"
        []Added the class "TextEditorGroup". This class adds 'tab' functionality and maintains the
            state of the new Blazor component named "TextEditorGroupDisplay.razor".
        []The TextEditor's gutter and body have separate parent HTML elements which they
            are positioned relative to.
            [](the gutter and body are position: absolute and previous versions had
                bugs involving the body being displayed within the gutter do to incorrectly
                calculating the CSS 'left' attribute value.)
    []TextEditorViewModelDisplay.razor instead of TextEditorDisplay.razor
        []Blazor Parameter is Type: "TextEditorViewModelKey".
    []Change FileExtension from Blazor Parameter to property on the TextEditorBase.cs
    []Rename to 'LOCAL_STORAGE_GLOBAL_TEXT_EDITOR_OPTIONS_KEY'
    []Remove the IncludeDefaultAutocompleteMenu and IncludeDefaultContextMenu
        []The respective override parameters still exist. The removed parts were redundant
            as one would just provide an override if they don't want the default.
    []Remove 'ShouldRemeasureFlag' from the TextEditorViewModelDisplay.razor
        []Use the method: "TextEditorService.SetViewModelWith(...)" and the
            record keyword "with" to mutate the desired TextEditorViewModel's ShouldMeasureDimensions
            property.

[]BUG: Currently is not rerendering after measuring
[]BUG: Margin-ScrollHeight is breaking the line numbers.
    []BUG: The line numbers are being displaced from top by the amount of margin

[X]Check that the JavaScript interop calls that use 'getElementById' return early if the result was undefined.
[X]Maybe should move the text selection div to inside the "bte_body-section"
[X]Make the sure overflow: hidden is on the correct HTML element.
    []Give the body the "overflow: hidden" and the gutter gets
        a reference to the OnWheelAsync method so it can scroll the body too.
        []The scroll dispatches an event and thus the gutter will rerender even though
            it is not technically scrolling.
[X]Need to fix the context menu mouse events not working for the TextEditor
[]Need to fix the [BUG] issues on the GitHub hosted repo.
    [][Bug] The gutter overlaps the text
        []Fix row css positioning
    [][Bug] The indent isn't working correctly
        []Was never sure what the comment meant by this.
            []I presume he means that I don't have implemented
                selecting text then hitting the tab key to indent it.
                []Perhaps for the next update find time to implement this?
    [][Bug] The component has a lot of dependencies (50MB download WASM files)
        []Compile the WASM app correctly.
            []TreeShaking and such.
    [][Bug] Incorrect placement of cursor on editor in demo
        []Fix row css positioning
    [][Bug] Demo showing code incorrectly on Chrome
        []Fix row css positioning
    [][Bug] Writing in demo disables intellisense
        []Is something wrong with how the SemaphoreSlim
            logic is written thereby causing a deadlock?
[]Update the:
    []README.md
    []CHANGELOG.md
    []CHANGELOG.md
    []00_INSTALLATION.md
    []10_USAGE.md
    []20_SETTINGS.md
    []Enough changes occurred to necessitate the re-recording of Getting started the Video Format
        []"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HuqQ4e1q7g"

[]BlazorStudio
    []Locally package the BlazorALaCarte Library NuGet Packages
        []BlazorALaCarte.Shared
        []BlazorALaCarte.DialogNotification
        []BlazorALaCarte.TreeView
    []Locally package the Blazor.Text.Editor NuGet Package
    []Update BlazorStudio git repo so it can be cloned and ran without any additional steps.
        []This will be accomplished due to the BlazorALaCarte Library and Blazor.Text.Editor Library
            both being referenced as NuGet Packages.
    []Update the BlazorStudio README.md with instructions on how to clone and run the Repository.
    []Make a youtube video where you preferrably in under a minute clone and run BlazorStudio
        []NOTE: under a minute is a bit extreme but hopefully the idea is conveyed. The video
            is to be very to the point.
        []Update the BlazorStudio README.md to in addition to the text instructions on how to clone and run the Repository
            include a link to the video format.
