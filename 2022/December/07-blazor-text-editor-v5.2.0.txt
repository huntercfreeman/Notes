# Goal
{

[]If less than viewable height of rows are shown the scroll does not
    occur.
    []This was a hack to fix a bug regarding starting with row 1 and only having 1 row
        you'd eventually as you add rows find yourself scrolling even though the viewable height is not filled.
        []This hack results in the bug where if you delete enough text to have a rowCount that does
            not fill the vertical viewable height then and your cursor is out of view.
            []You will not get scrolled into view automatically
                []Must click editor or interact with the scroll wheel
[]remove dead // TODO: comments that were accidentally left
    []2 are in the RazorSyntaxTree.cs ReadCodeBlock method
[]Following block of text does not lex correctly. The inner for loops '{' is never being accounted for an the outer @for() loop closes early?
