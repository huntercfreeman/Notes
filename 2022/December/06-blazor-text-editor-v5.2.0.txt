# Goal
{

[]Razor needs better ILexer implementation as 
    []@code{...}
    []@code
      {

      }
    []Previous two @code examples must be syntaxed highlighted
        properly.
        []Currently only the
            []@code{...}
                []Is syntax highlighted properly
[]Added in Svelte ILexer to work on alongside Razor ILexer.
    Helps with InjectedLanguageDefinition.cs figuring out what
    is needed.

[]The TextEditorDisplay scrollbar should listen for mousemove
    events in the viewport instead of the current functionality.
    []The current functionality is to listen for mousemove events
        within the rendered scrollbar html element.
        []This feels very awkward to use currently so
            using mousemove on viewport and displacing the
            scrollbar based on a position diff between 
            current and previous events instead of taking
            mouse position at time of event will
            feel much more natural.
[]When out of view of the first line and deleting all the Text
    one finds themselves NOT having the first line scrolled
    into view. This is erroneous and needs fixed.

# Plan
{

[]Regarding .razor file parsing
    []An ILexer should be composable from other
        ILexer implementations
        []Then the ILexer which is a composition of others
            would only have parsing logic to determine
            which ILexer it is composed of gets control.
            []Once an inner ILexer gets control the idea
                is that the inner ILexer performs its
                operation and then returns back to the
                parent ILexer which has the main while() 
                loop.
                []This then gives the other inner ILexer
                    implementations a chance to take control.
    []Examples of ILexers made by composition of inner ILexers (two
        examples are used as to not have an overly narrow understanding
        of mixing HTML and an injected language):
        []RazorLexer.cs 
        // find answer to this question: is .cshtml exactly the same in regards to lexing - just different file extension?
        // Reading this to see what it says about razor: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/getting-started/introducing-razor-syntax-c
        // regarding ^ make notes while reading below
        // Visual Basic is supported in razor see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-pages/overview/getting-started/introducing-razor-syntax-vb
            []Inner ILexer(s)
                []HtmlLexer.cs
                []CSharpLexer.cs
            []Conditions to give an inner ILexer control
                []'@' is the indicator that what follows is
                    a C# injected language fragment.
            []Comment syntaxes
                []Multi Line Razor Comment:
                    []Start: '@*'
                    []End: '*@'
                []Multi Line Html Comment:
                    []Start: '<!--'
                    []End: '-->'
        []SvelteLexer.css
            []Inner ILexer(s)
                []User chooses between
                    []JavaScriptLexer.cs
                    []TypeScriptLexer.cs
                []HtmlLexer.cs
                []CssLexer.cs
            []Conditions to give an inner ILexer control
                []<script> tag
                    []<script lang="ts">
                        []TypeScriptLexer.cs
                    []<script>
                        []JavaScriptLexer.cs
                []Top level text is treated as HTML if not a
                    matching tag which specifies a specific ILexer
                    []HtmlLexer.cs
                        []The '{' and '}' characters deliminate swapping
                            to the corresponding ILexer which is chosen
                            in the user's <script> tag. The default
                            ILexer is JavaScriptLexer.
                []<style> tag
                    []CssLexer.cs
            []Comment syntaxes
