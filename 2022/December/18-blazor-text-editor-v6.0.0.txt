# Goal
{

[]Make an "a la carte" Blazor component library.
    []Break out all the Blazor components I made into their own separate public GitHub repository.
    []Package all the separate GitHub repos for the various components as their own NuGet Packages.
    []In BlazorStudio remove all source code related to those Blazor components which were moved into their
        own separate git repositories and separate NuGet Packages.
    []In BlazorStudio reference all the NuGet Packages which were published of the various components.
        []This makes BlazorStudio incredibly easy to clone so it is vital to reference the NuGet Packages
            not the source code.
    []This is "a la carte" as every component will have its own GitHub repo and corresponding NuGet Package.
        []If one wishes to have the source code they can go to the GitHub repo. If they just want to install
            the nuget package they have that option as well.
        []They also can choose just the components they want.
    []Components
        []BlazorMenu
        []BlazorResize
        []BlazorDrag
        []BlazorNotifications
        []BlazorTheme
        []BlazorVirtualization
        []BlazorTreeView
        []BlazorTextEditor
        []BlazorDropdown
        []BlazorDialog
    []Interfaces
        []IDragService
        []IResizeService
        []IThemeService
        []ITreeViewService
        []ITextEditorService
        []IVirtualizationService
        []IDropdownService
        []IMenuService
[]After making the "a la carte" Blazor component library.
    []Update BlazorStudio's README.md(s)
    []Make a youtube video for the "Make an IDE from scratch using Blazor and C#" playlist
        []Showcase how to clone BlazorStudio
        []Next, showcase how to Publish BlazorStudio to a local folder
        []Next, showcase running the BlazorStudio executable from that published folder
[]Next, update the personal website to be a Blazor WebAssembly application
    []Which has the Blazor template and each navlink is each component.
    []On each components url @page include
        []An example of the component.
        []A link to the GitHub hosted source code
        []A link to the nuget.org NuGet Package
[]Write README.md(s) for the various Blazor components.
[]Make a youtube video where you go through and make a brand new Blazor ServerSide Application
    everytime to show how to install/setup the various Blazor components.
    []When you have the video publicly uploaded add a link to it in the corresponding
        Blazor component's README.md
