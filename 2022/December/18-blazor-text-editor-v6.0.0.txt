# Goal
{

[]Make an "a la carte" Blazor component library.
    []Break out all the Blazor components I made into their own separate public GitHub repository.
    []Package all the separate GitHub repos for the various components as their own NuGet Packages.
    []In BlazorStudio remove all source code related to those Blazor components which were moved into their
        own separate git repositories and separate NuGet Packages.
    []In BlazorStudio reference all the NuGet Packages which were published of the various components.
        []This makes BlazorStudio incredibly easy to clone so it is vital to reference the NuGet Packages
            not the source code.
    []This is "a la carte" as every component will have its own GitHub repo and corresponding NuGet Package.
        []If one wishes to have the source code they can go to the GitHub repo. If they just want to install
            the nuget package they have that option as well.
        []They also can choose just the components they want.
    []Components
        []BlazorMenu
        []BlazorResize
        []BlazorDrag
        []BlazorNotifications
        []BlazorTheme
        []BlazorVirtualization
        []BlazorTreeView
        []BlazorTextEditor

        []IVirtualizationService
        []IDropdownService
