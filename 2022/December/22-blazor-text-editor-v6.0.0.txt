# Goal
{

[]Work on finishing Blazor.Text.Editor (choose the update version: v6.0.0 or v5.3.0)
[]List Changes Here:
    []TextEditorViewModelDisplay.razor instead of TextEditorDisplay.razor
    []Change FileExtension from Blazor Parameter to property on the TextEditorBase.cs

// ScrollHorizontal, ScrollVertical, and CursorDisplay need to have TextEditorDisplay parameter
    replaced the the TextEditorViewModel

[]Check that the JavaScript interop calls that use 'getElementById' return early if the result was undefined.
[]Maybe should move the text selection div to inside the "bte_body-section"
[]Make the sure overflow: hidden is on the correct HTML element.
    []Give the body the "overflow: hidden" and the gutter gets
        a reference to the OnWheelAsync method so it can scroll the body too.
        []The scroll dispatches an event and thus the gutter will rerender even though
            it is not technically scrolling.
[X]Need to fix the context menu mouse events not working for the TextEditor
[]Need to fix the [BUG] issues on the GitHub hosted repo.
    [][Bug] The gutter overlaps the text
        []Fix row css positioning
    [][Bug] The indent isn't working correctly
        []Was never sure what the comment meant by this.
            []I presume he means that I don't have implemented
                selecting text then hitting the tab key to indent it.
                []Perhaps for the next update find time to implement this?
    [][Bug] The component has a lot of dependencies (50MB download WASM files)
        []Compile the WASM app correctly.
            []TreeShaking and such.
    [][Bug] Incorrect placement of cursor on editor in demo
        []Fix row css positioning
    [][Bug] Demo showing code incorrectly on Chrome
        []Fix row css positioning
    [][Bug] Writing in demo disables intellisense
        []Is something wrong with how the SemaphoreSlim
            logic is written thereby causing a deadlock?
[]Update the:
    []README.md
    []CHANGELOG.md
    []CHANGELOG.md
    []00_INSTALLATION.md
    []10_USAGE.md
    []20_SETTINGS.md

[]BlazorStudio
    []Locally package the BlazorALaCarte Library NuGet Packages
        []BlazorALaCarte.Shared
        []BlazorALaCarte.DialogNotification
        []BlazorALaCarte.TreeView
    []Locally package the Blazor.Text.Editor NuGet Package
    []Update BlazorStudio git repo so it can be cloned and ran without any additional steps.
        []This will be accomplished due to the BlazorALaCarte Library and Blazor.Text.Editor Library
            both being referenced as NuGet Packages.
    []Update the BlazorStudio README.md with instructions on how to clone and run the Repository.
    []Make a youtube video where you preferrably in under a minute clone and run BlazorStudio
        []NOTE: under a minute is a bit extreme but hopefully the idea is conveyed. The video
            is to be very to the point.
        []Update the BlazorStudio README.md to in addition to the text instructions on how to clone and run the Repository
            include a link to the video format.

[]Stuck need to think
    []Step 1 measure character width and row height.
    []Step 2 calculate the width of the gutter.
    []Step 3 calculate the width of the body.
        []Found by { widthOfContent - widthOfGutter => widthOfBody }
