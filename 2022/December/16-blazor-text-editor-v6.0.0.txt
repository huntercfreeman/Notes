# Goal
{

[]Implement Text Editor Tabs
    []Need to make the UI for the TextEditorGroup tabs look nice.
        []Show the active TextEditorGroup tab with a differing background color
            from the non active entries.
        []Show the ResourceUri for the given TextEditorView tab which is active
            in a TextEditorGroup
        []@onclick for the tabs should set that tab as active.
        []Tabs must be <button> HTML elements to allow for automatic registering
            of 'submit' like keydown events triggering the @onclick

[]/* TODO: 2022-12-16 I need to separate out new css from old css for a moment using this comment put put them back together eventually */
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Go through the old css above this todo and delete anything not being used anymore */
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Every color must be a css variable */
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Every size must be a css variable */
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Every z-index must be a css variable */
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Everything ever must be a css variable */
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Figure out what you want to take from the Demo source code to be moved over as just part of the library itself */
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Delete any duplicated css. For example, perhaps css exists in both the library and the demo for no reason at all. Just keep it in the library only then. */ 
  /* TODO: 2022-12-16 Delete every unused css variable unless a justification can be made for its existence. */

[]BUG: One can put a resizable dialog off screen and it becomes stuck.
