# Goal
{

[]Make these keymap changes
    []{ "Ctrl" + 'd' }
        [X]Duplicate selection.
        [X]If no selection, duplicate line.
    []{ "Ctrl" + 'c' }
        [X]Copy selection.
        []If no selection, copy line.
    []{ "Ctrl" + 'x' }
        [X]Cut selection.
        []If no selection, cut line.
    []{ "Tab" }
        []Insert a tab character at the beginning of every line with a selection on it.
        [X]If no selection, insert tab character at cursor position.
    []{ "Shift" + "Tab" }
        []With a selection, apply logic to every line with a selection on it. Remove either a tab character from the beginning of every line if its the first character found.
            []Or remove up to at max {TAB_WIDTH} space characters if they are the first characters found.
        [X]If no selection, apply logic to the current line the cursor is one. Remove either a tab character from the beginning of every line if its the first character found.
            []Or remove up to at max {TAB_WIDTH} space characters if they are the first characters found.

[]Make these virtualization changes
    []In general optimize when virtualization occurs.
        []I am doing it too often in some cases, while also doing it not at all in others.
    []Situation: "User has horizontal scroll > 0. They then click such that their 'relative coordinate'
        maps to a column index of 0. This scrolls the horizontal position to 0."
        []In this situation there is a bug wherein the virtualization will not be recalculated.
