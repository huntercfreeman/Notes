# Goal
{

[]Implement as much of the Vim keymap today as possible
    []Grammar.Command => "C"
    []Grammar.Repeat => "R"
    []Grammar.Motion => "M"
    []Grammar.Expansion => "E"
    []Mostly focus on:
        []The general architecture of how changing ones keymap
            works.
        []The main grammar of Vim (? what are the names of these I am unsure)
            []Commands
                []d -> delete
                []v -> select
            []Motions
                []w -> word
                []e -> end
                []
            []Expansion
                []i -> inner
                []
            []Repeat
                []1 -> 1x
                []2 -> 2x
                []....N -> Nx
                []....(N + 1) -> (N + 1)x
                []What is the minimum repeat?
                []What is the maximum repeat?
        []Valid Combinations of Keymap Grammar (Verbose Documentation)
            []Command First
                []Expansion Second
                    []Motion Third
                        []Example: viw => { "Select", "ExpandInner", "Word" } => Select the text representing the word the cursor is currently within
                []Motion Second
                    []Example: dw => { "Delete", "Word" } => Delete the remaining text of the word the cursor is within.
                []Repeat Second
                    []Motion Third
            []Motion First
                []w
                    []Go the remaining length of the current word
            []Repeat First
                []Motion Second
                    []3w => { "for(0 excluding 3)", "Word" } => Repeat 3 times: Go the remaining length of the current word
        []Valid Combinations of Keymap Grammar (Succinct Documentation)
            []Command
                []Expand
                    []Motion
                []Motion
                []Repeat
                    []Motion
            []Motion
            []Repeat
                []Motion
        []The main Modes of Vim (? what are the names of these I am unsure)
            []Normal
                []Initial Mode
                []Uses Vim Grammar
            []Insert
                []Falls back to the default keymap unless
                    an override is defined.
                    []An example override would be the
                        keyboard input: { "Escape" } which will
                        change the user's active mode to "NormalMode"
            []Visual
                []Uses Vim Grammar
                []Selection is more fine grained and can be
                    part of a line.
            []Visual-Block
                []Uses Vim Grammar
                []Selection is based on all or nothing selection of a line.
            []Command



    

[]Look into horizontal scrolling
    [X]Deleted the weird change but still look into horizontal scrolling
