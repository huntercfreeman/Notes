# Goal
{

[]Findings from using v5.2.0 with BlazorStudio
    NOTE: Assume "using the webview from Ubuntu" unless stated otherwise
    []/wwwroot/css/open-iconic/font/css/open-iconic-bootstrap.min.css
        []Opening this file resulted in no horizontal scrollbar
            likely due to integer overflow into a negative value?
    []/wwwroot/css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css.map
        []Opening this file resulted in no horizontal scrollbar
            likely due to integer overflow into a negative value?
            []Also not filling the vertical space with rows will result
                in keyboard movements which go horizontally out of view will not scroll the
                cursor into view.
                []This is already known in regards to the cause see the vertical case.
    []/Pages/Index.razor is not syntax highlighting <SurveyPrompt .../> correctly
        []The Title attribute has a value which has spaces in it. Is this related?
    []/Shared/NavMenu.razor is not syntax highlighting <NavLink ... href="" ...> correctly
        []The href attribute lacks a value (it is an empty string). Is this related?
    []The scrollbars should have onmousemove diffs relative to the viewport instead of
        exact position movement relative to the tiny scrollbar height/width.
    []Changing tabs does not reset scroll position
    []Holding ShiftKey + mousewheeling does not scroll horizontally.
    []If the vertical space is not filled by rows one can scroll infinitely
    []Always can horizontally scroll infinitely(??? unsure of this)
    []FUTURE: cursors should be stored separate from
        the UI so when changing tabs the cursor position stays the same.
        []FUTURE: Store scroll position too?
    []Regarding the below note "If less than viewable height of rows are shown
        the scroll does not occur."
        []In BlazorStudio when using the webview from Ubuntu NOTHING will scroll it into view
            other than scrolling manually.
    []FetchData.razor from the Blazor ServerSide template
        []@if (forecasts == null){...} not syntax highlighting due to depth of inner HTML tags?
        []@foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
            []When syntax highlighting keywords make sure the end of A WORD is checked against.
                []Meaning, currently erroneously in this file @forecast will 
                    syntax highlight @for because it for is a keyword and a substring of
                    forecast. 
                    []Must do a match on entire upcoming word.
    []In BlazorStudio 
        []setup .json to use the corresponding JSON Lexer
            and then check the output for the .json files in the solution.
            []/Properties/launchSettings.json is one of such JSON files.
        []setup .css to use the corresponding CSS Lexer
            and then check the output for the .css files in the solution.
            []/wwwroot/css/site.css is one of such CSS files.
        []setup .cshtml to use the corresponding Razor Lexer
            and then check the output for the .cshtml files in the solution.
            []/Pages/_Layout.cshtml is one of such cshtml files.
    []Shift scroll is not working



[]If less than viewable height of rows are shown the scroll does not
    occur.
    []This was a hack to fix a bug regarding starting with row 1 and only having 1 row
        you'd eventually as you add rows find yourself scrolling even though the viewable height is not filled.
        []This hack results in the bug where if you delete enough text to have a rowCount that does
            not fill the vertical viewable height then and your cursor is out of view.
            []You will not get scrolled into view automatically
                []Must click editor or interact with the scroll wheel
[]remove dead // TODO: comments that were accidentally left
    []2 are in the RazorSyntaxTree.cs ReadCodeBlock method
[]Following block of text does not lex correctly. The inner for loops '{' is never being accounted for an the outer @for() loop closes early?
{
    <input type="number" @bind="_incrementBy"/>

@for (int i = 0; i < _incrementBy; i++)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

	<div class="demo_counter">
		<button class="demo_increment-count-button">
			@_count;
		</button>
	</div>
 
	for (int i = 0; i < _incrementBy; i++)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

		<div class="demo_counter">
			<button class="demo_increment-count-button">
				@_count;

		</div>
	}
	<div class="demo_counter">
		<button class="demo_increment-count-button">
			@_count;

	</div>
}

@code 
{
	private int _count;
	private int _incrementBy = 1;

	private void IncrementCount()
	{
		_count++;
