# Goal
{

[]Fix ScrollBar Components.
    []When scrolling vertically there appears to be a rounding error
        when transitioning from a scrollTop which is less than what is the maximum
        to a scrollTop which is equal or greater than the maximum.
        []The behavior that occurs is that the vertical scrollbar will jump up
            by some amount of pixels and keep the final line or final few lines from
            ever being in view.
        []Take measurements of the ScrollBar components using dev inspect element tools
            [].bte_scrollbar-section => 905.133 x 518.267 (looks correct)
            [].bte_scrollbar-horizontal => 895 x 10 (looks correct)
	            [].bte_scrollbar-slider => 0 x 10 (looks wrong)
                    []NOTE: (looks wrong) because shouldn't the width of the slider should
                        fill the width of the horizontal scrollbar as the page is fully displayed?
                        []Or should the horizontal scrollbar be display: none entirely as there
                            is nothing that can be horizontally scrolled.
            [].bte_scrollbar-vertical => 10 x 508.267
                [].bte_scrollbar-slider => 10 x 797.400

[]Add Vertical ScrollHeight Margin
[]Add Horizontal ScrollWidth Margin

[]SolutionExplorerTreeViewKeymap.cs
    []{ EnterKey } => 
        []Create Model
        []Create ViewModel
        []Add ViewModel to BlazorStudio's TextEditorGroup
        []Make ViewModel the active tab
        []Set focus to the ViewModel
    []{ SpaceKey } =>
        []Create Model
        []Create ViewModel
        []Set the PreviewViewModel of the BlazorStudio's TextEditorGroup
            to this ViewModel.
        []Make PreviewViewModel the active tab
    []{ Ctrl + Alt + l } =>
        []Set focus to the SolutionExplorer

[]Make these virtualization changes
    []In general optimize when virtualization occurs.
        []I am doing it too often in some cases, while also doing it not at all in others.
    []Situation: "User has horizontal scroll > 0. They then click such that their 'relative coordinate'
        maps to a column index of 0. This scrolls the horizontal position to 0."
        []In this situation there is a bug wherein the virtualization will not be recalculated.

[]Update the README.md for BlazorStudio
