[]Add the following file templates
[]Add the ability for one to create custom file templates
[]Add ability to define nesting rules for arbitrary files
    []In otherwords codebehinds
    []Example: 
        [].razor and .razor.cs
            []{match-filename}.{matched-extension}.{other}
        []appsettings.json and appsettings.development.json
            []{match-filename}.{other}.{matched-extension}
}

# Plan
{
[]Blazor.Text.Editor nuget package will be used as the 
    text editor and the nuget package will be updated throughout
    the making of the IDE
[]Make aware of
    []Text Editor from scratch with Blazor and C# youtube playlist
    []Web links in the youtube video description
[]Go through the initial features as to define
    a starting point for the series.
    []Make clear that the starting point is code added
        to the result of the text editor from scratch youtube series
[]Initial features
    []InputFile dialog to select solution
    []SolutionExplorer to view Solution and Project structure
    []TextEditor to edit files
    []Syntax highlighting within the TextEditor
    []Editor has tabs to allow editing of many files
    []After selecting a Solution the MSBuild version is found
        []Setting a startup project will show green play button
        []After clicking the green play button
            []dotnet run --project '{startupProject}'
    []Results of commands are shown in the terminal display
[]Explain the plan for the video series
    []Plan is to do shorter videos around 15 minutes long
        (no longer than 30 minutes)
    []I am going to program a feature myself off camera
        and then go through the code on camera after the fact.
    []There will likely be 'side' videos that are made
        as an entirely separate adhoc C# project
        to showcase a general Blazor / C# concept I found interesting
        while implementing a feature.
