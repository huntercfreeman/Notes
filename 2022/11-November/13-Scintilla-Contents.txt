Scintilla has the following features
listed under their 'Contents'
section. BlazorTextEditor is to do all of these
listed features and do them correctly.

There is no excuse not to have a feature implemented.

I will be sure that throughout the process of implementing
these features:
[]Reflect on what I appear to have done right
    and what I appear to have done wrong.
    []The outcome of a situation does not directly
        correlate with it being the right or wrong decision.
        []If one were to say to me, "I will give you $100 if you
            can land on heads". Then they show me two different coins I can
            choose from. One is heads and tails either side. The other
            is heads on both sides. To pick the coin with heads and
            tails on either side and win the $100 dollars is the wrong
            decision - even though I won.
[]Metacognition combined with reflecting on experience
    is the key to solving any problem.
    []I must not attempt to program any of the Scintilla features
        by banging my head against the keyboard.
        []If there is to be a feature of BlazorTextEditor 
            that is deemed to function correctly.
            []Remember that you had no idea what you were doing
                initially but that you broke the problem down
                into smaller and smaller problems that were
                managible given my level of programming experience.
                []Then almost like a recursive function you bubbled
                    up the results from the smaller questions
                    and ended up with the answer to the larger one.
                    []Even now I look at what BlazorTextEditor is today
                        and doubt to myself that I even was the one
                        who wrote it up to this point.
                        []The point is I've shown myself that I have
                            a constant sense of self doubt even on
                            accomplishments and I cannot let my
                            doubtful thoughts to get me.
[]Do not think of the individuals that worked on Scintilla
    as being more intelligent than I am.
    []Perhaps there is a concept of intellegence
        but from the perspective of the average
        person - not a neuroscientist it is irrelevant.
        []I am not to justify my failure to make this text editor
            by throwing my hands up in the air and saying,
            "well they are just smarter than I am".
            []Minor differences in the conducitivity of
                one individuals myelin sheath from
                another to are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.
                []What matters is that I approach intellegence
                    from the persepctive of it being a threshold
                    of 'not able to learn' vs 'able to learn'.
                    []I must not believe the idea that some individuals are
                        naturally skilled at certain activities.
                        []I am a horrible artist but its because I don't enjoy it,
                            and thereby do not practice that skill. If I truly wanted to
                            I could become one of the best artists in the world.
                            []The requirement for this would be a combination
                                of reflecting on experience, metacognition, and
                                my brain releasing the chemicals necessary
                                for one to be able to focus.
                                []At the end of the day my brain does not reward me
                                    when I draw. It does however feel rewarding
                                    to program and with every day I can get better.
