[]Implement the following Vim Modes
    []Visual (v)
        []There are three states to consider.
            []Immediately upon hitting 'v'
                []The selection anchor is
                    where the cursor would be positioned if it were
                    rendered as a Beam.
                []The selection end is 1 greater than what the current
                    position index of the cursor is.
            []Following the immediate switch into Visual mode
                the user might take one of two actions.
                []Perform a movement that traverses the cursor
                    deeper into the text document.
                    []In this case, the anchor can be left unchanged.
                        The selection end would need to be set to 1 greater
                        than the position index of their cursor after the movement.
                        []Note that out of bound array indexing checks would be needed
                            here as one could go 1 character beyond the final character
                            in the text. Ensure this does not break anything.
                []Perform a movement that traverses the cursor
                    towards the start of the text document.
                    []In this case, the anchor should become the text selection upperbound.
                        The selection end should be set as whatever the user's position index
                        is of their cursor after the movement is performed.

    []Visual Line (V)
        []There are three states to consider.
            []Immediately upon hitting 'V'
                []The selection anchor at the start of the row which the cursor is on.
                []The selection is at the exclusive ending position index for the
                    row which the cursor is on.
            []Following the immediate switch into Visual mode
                the user might take one of two actions.
                []Perform a movement that traverses the cursor
                    deeper into the text document.
                    []In this case, the anchor can be left unchanged.
                        The selection end gets set as the exclusive ending position index for the
                        row which the cursor is on.
                        []Note that out of bound array indexing checks would be needed

                        The selection end should be set as the inclusive starting position index for the
                        row which the cursor is on.
