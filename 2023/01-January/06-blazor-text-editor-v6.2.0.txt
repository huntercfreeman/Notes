[]List of the various sections of the IDE in regards to a top level layout
    structuring.
    []Left Panel
        []The tabs for viewable panes in this panel extends height of
            calc(
                []100vh 
                []- var(--HEIGHT_OF_TOP_HEADER)
                []- var(--HEIGHT_OF_PANEL_TAB)
                    []This functions exactly the same as how
                        a vertical and horizontal scrollbar cannot go
                        100% of the height or width. They both get stopped early
                        by a 'scrollbar connector'.
            )
        []The viewable portion of this panel extends
            calc(
                []100vh 
                []- var(--HEIGHT_OF_TOP_HEADER)
                []- var(--HEIGHT_OF_PANEL_TAB)
                    []This height of panel tab relates to the height taken
                        by the bottom panel's tabs.
                []- var(--HEIGHT_OF_BOTTOM_PANEL_VIEWABLE_SPACE)
                    []The bottom panel viewable space might be 0 at times
                        if the bottom panel is collapsed.
                        []However the height of panel tabs which comes from
                        the bottom panel will always be there.
            )
    []Bottom Panel
    []Right Panel
    []Top Header
    []The Text-Editor section is sandwiched horiztonally
        by the 'left panel' and 'right panel'
    []The Text-Editor section is sandwiched vertically
        by the 'bottom panel' and 'top header'

[]Panels to replicate Visual Studio drag and drop
    to move windows where one pleases and dock them.
    []Break out sections of the IDE where panels can be viewed
        exist
        []Left
        []Bottom
        []Right
        []
    []Every panel display can be broken into two dropdownzones
        []A vertical panel would have two vertical dropdzones, one on north end
            one on the south end.
    []Implementation
        []Left
            []Solution Explorer
            []Folder Explorer
            []Commit (Git Changes)
            []
        []Bottom
        []Right



[]Add git integration to BlazorStudio
    []Add diff view to Blazor.Text.Editor
